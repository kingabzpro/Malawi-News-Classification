The project code is simple and effective on competitive grounds. I have experimented with Vectorizer, Porter stemmer for test preprocessing. I have also used multiple methods to clean my text to improved overall model performance. In the end, I have used SKlearn Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) classifier for predicting News categories. I have also experimented with various neural networks and gradient boosting models, but they all failed as simple logistics regression with minimum hyperparameter tunning works quite well on this data.
